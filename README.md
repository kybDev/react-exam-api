If you dont have a MongoDB Server available and you have Docker installed in your local machine just run the docker-compose.yml file and your good to go.<br>

NOTE ON DOCKER WINDOWS: (optional just comment the volume if unuse)
Set the full path where you do want to store the MongoDB volume in docker-compose.yml file the reason for this is that when you stop and run the docker-compose.yml it will load your previous records.
